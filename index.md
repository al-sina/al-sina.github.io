Welcome to my personal webpage. I am Adolfo Alsina, a theoretical physicist working at the interface between physics and biology. <br><br> 

A fascinating property of biological systems is their capability to reliably perform complex functions in noisy environments. My research is centred around the question of how can biological systems integrate processes at different levels of organisation to robustly perform a large variety of functions. In particular, I explore this question in different settings ranging from unicellular organisms, such as budding yeast, to collectives of social insects using a combination of analytical tools and numerical methods borrowed from statistical physics, non-equilibrium physics and data science. <br><br>

Currently I am an assistant professor (Profesor Ayudante Doctor) at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC) in Madrid, Spain. You can contact me at adolfo[dot]alsina[at]urjc.es
