<p style='text-align:justify'>My research is centred around the question of how can biological systems integrate processes at different levels of organisation, from the microscopic to the macroscopic, to robustly perform a large variety of functions. Below there is a list of my current research interests in no particular order.</p>

## Multiscale control of cell-cycle dynamics

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">The cell cycle of eukaryotic cells is a highly regulated process, composed of several steps that need to be carefully orchestrated and completed in a timely manner. Nevertheless, the timing of cell cycle events presents both cell-to-cell variability and dependence on environmental conditions such as temperature or nutrient abundance. To disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the timing of cell cycle events, I have developed a bayesian inference framework that extracts these contributions from high-throughput flow cytometry data.</p>

## Disregulation of tissue homeostasis

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Despite their out of equilibrum nature, biological systems can maintain physiological variables in an optimal operational regime, a property known as homeostasis. However, homeostasic properties can be altered in response to internal and environmental signals. By focusing on a minimal in vitro model of a tissue, I study the role of intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations in the disregulation of tissue homeostasis and how the interplay between the two shapes the dynamics of the system.</p>

## Phenotypic plasticity in social insects

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Biological systems can form and maintain complex structures in noisy environments while, at the same time, retaining the capability of remodelling such structures in response to the right cues. To address how biological systems simultaneously achieve robust specialisation and rapid plasticity, I have studied how these properties emerge from the interplay between processes taking place at the molecular and population levels in colonies of primitively social insects.</p>

## Driven stochastic many-particle systems

Active systems exhibit collective properties not present in their passive counterparts, such as flocking or motility induced phase separation. These properties arise as a result of the nature of inter-particle interactions, which are commonly considered to be time independent. However, in many situations of interest the interactions are shaped by the dynamics themselves. Inspired by living systems constantly adapting to changes in their surroundings, we propose a minimal model for adaptive active matter as a stochastic lattice gas of particles driven by deep neural networks. In particular, we study the emergence of collective behaviour from inter-particle interactions that depend on the history of the dynamics.</p>
